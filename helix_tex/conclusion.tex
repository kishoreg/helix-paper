\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%
At \linkedin we have built a sophisticated infrastructure stack of DDSs, including
offline data storage, data transport, data serving and search systems.  This
experience has put us in great position to observe the complex, but common,
cluster management tasks that pervade all of our DDSs.  This motivated us to
build \helix.  We designed \helix with a diverse set of DDSs in mind to ensure
its generality.

\helix lets DDSs declare their behavior through a set of pluggable interfaces.
Chief among these interfaces are a state machine that lets the DDS declare the
possible states of their partitions and transitions between them, and constraints 
that must met for each partition.  In this way, DDS designers concentrate on
the logic of the system, while the \helix execution algorithm carries out transitions in the distributed
setting.  

We have had a lot of success with \helix at \linkedin.  By providing the
performance and functionality a DDS would normally target for itself, we have indeed
offloaded cluster manager work from a number of DDSs.  \helix even lets these DDSs
make what would normally be drastic changes to the way they are managed with
just minor changes to the \helix state model.    

We have a number of future directions for \helix.  One of them is to simply
increase its adoption, a goal we expect our open-source release to accelerate.
A second goal is to manage more complex types of clusters.  The first challenge
is to handle heterogeneous node types; we plan to approach this with the notion
of \emph{node groups}.  We cluster nodes by capabilities (cpu, disk capacity,
\etc) and weight more performant groups to host larger numbers of partitions. 
The second challenge is to manage clusters over increasingly complex network
topologies, including those that span multiple data centers.  

A third goal is to push more load balancing responsibility into \helix.  \helix's
alerting framework lets it observe imbalance, and we must continue to extend the
\helix execution algorithm to to respond to imbalance, yet remain completely
generic across DDSs.
